# KaoBook Social Media App
KaoBook is a social media application that I created for the last project of The Odin Project. You can create an account, login, add & manage friends, create posts on your timeline, and like & comment on other posts.

Live Demo: [here](https://kaobook.club/)

Some of the technologies that were used in this application: 

* Javascript
* Vue
* Vuetify
* NodeJS
* Express
* MongoDB
* Docker
* nginx

## Accounts
If you are not interested in creating a new account but want to see the app in action, you can login into some of the dummy accounts that I've created.
